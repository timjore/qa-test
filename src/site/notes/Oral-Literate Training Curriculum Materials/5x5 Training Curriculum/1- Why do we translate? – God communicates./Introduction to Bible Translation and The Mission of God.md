# Church and Community Based Bible Translation

## Introduction

We believe that the ministry of Bible translation is central to the mission of God. Since the Word of God is translatable into any language, Bible translation is one of the key ways God reveals Himself in the worlds cultures and languages.

God calls the Church to participate with Him in accomplishing His mission, so Bible translation is primarily a ministry the Church. We are committed to the vision of the Church providing leadership in the planning and implementation of Bible translation programs. This Church and Community Based Bible Translation process is being developed to support the vision of Bible translation as a ministry of the Church. It is presented in four major topics:

- Introduction to Bible Translation and The Mission of God
- Introduction to Qualities of a Good Translation
- Introduction to Oral-to-Literate Translation
- Introduction to Translation Processes

## Curriculum

Introduction to Bible Translation and The Mission of God

### **Session 1: The God who speaks**   

*(60 min. Read the passages aloud and discuss as a group.)*

1. Read the entire chapter of Genesis 1 aloud together as a group. Creation began when God said, "Let there be light and there was light." This point is repeated many times in Genesis 1 as God speaks and other aspects of creation come into existence. God said ... and there was. God could have brought creation into existence in any way, but he does it by speaking. He creates by his Word. 
2. Read Psalm 33:6-9 together. This is a beautiful, poetic way of expressing what happened at creation. Discuss this as a group if anyone has comments to share. 
3. Read John 1:1-4. John opens his Gospel with these important statements of how In the beginning, the Word already existed. The Word was with God and the Word was God. Nothing was created except through him. Jesus, the Living Word created everything that exists. 
4. Read Colossians 1:11-20. Emphasize the point that everything was created through Christ and he holds all creation together (1:16-17) 
5. Read Hebrews 1:1-4. Everything was created by the Living Word. God spoke everything into existence. In Hebrews 1:1-4, we are reminded that God spoke many times and in many ways in the past, but now in these days he has spoken through his Son who holds all things together by his powerful word. Our God speaks. Our God communicates. 

### **Session 2: The Mission of God**

*( 90 min. Assign each of the following topics to a small group. Provide each member of the group with an information sheet containing the Scripture passages and discussion questions for their topic. Allow 30 minutes for the groups to process their topic and prepare a 10 minute presentation to share with the whole group. As each group presents, have them write/represent their topic on a whiteboard. Facilitate a discussion using the discussion questions for each topic.)* 

#### **Humans created in God's image** 

1. Read Genesis 1:26-27 where we learn that we are all created in God's image. All humans, male and female, are created in His image. There are no exceptions. There are no humans created only 30% in his image and others 65% and yet others 90%. We are all equally created in his image! In his image, we were created to "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it" (Gen 1:28). We were created to reflect His image in this world. 
2. Read Genesis 9:6 and James 3:7-9. In these passages, the main point we learn is that being created in God's image has implications for how we treat each other as human beings. Human life should not be taken because we're created in His image (Gen 9:6). Other humans should not be cursed because they're made in His image (James 3:9). When we interact with other humans, we need to see them as others created in God's image. Our being created in God's image is the basis for all human equality and dignity. 
3. Human sinfulness has corrupted our ability to honor God and be in full relationship with Him, but sin does not erase God's image from us. "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Rom 3:23). Our ability to reflect God's image is damaged, but not removed. 

**Discussion:** What significance do you see in our being created in the image of God?

#### **God's Creation is Diverse** 

1. God didn't create just one kind of thing! He created all kinds of different things: different plants, different vegetation, different lights, different creatures, different animals, different birds, different kinds of fish. Human beings are also diverse. And it's important to remember that God looked at all that He had made and said that it was good, it was very good! (Gen 1:31) 
2. We also see diversity in the different gifts and functions we all have in the Body of Christ. As Paul wrote, "the body is not made up of one part but of many" (1 Cor 12:14). All the different parts need each other for the whole body to function well. This is part of God's design. He saw His diverse creation and said it was very good! 

**Discussion:** Where do you see or observe diversity in creation? Why do you think God created so many different things?

#### **We communicate because God communicates** 

1. Let's return to Genesis and how God spoke everything into existence. Let's consider one of the first responsibilities God gave Adam. God brought all the animals and birds to Adam to "to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one" (Gen 2:19). This would have been an amazing thing to witness! Just like God said "let there be" all the different parts of creation, Adam saw each animal and bird and said "let this be" its name and that was its name. God speaks and Adam speaks. In fact, we could say that this is an example of how Adam reflects the image of the God who speaks. 
2. In the opening chapters of Genesis, we have several examples of God communicating with Adam and Eve. The "God who speaks" is speaking or communicating with His people. God created us to communicate with Him and with each other. Scripture is full of examples of God communicating with His people at many times and in many ways (Heb 1:1-4). 

**Discussion:** What are different ways God has communicated? For example, through the prophets, through the psalmists, through those who wrote the various books of Scripture. The main point of this discussion is to increase awareness of the different ways God communicated in and through Scripture.

#### **You will be My Witnesses** 

1. When Jesus said to his disciples that they would be his witnesses, this was not a totally new idea. Just as the psalms say "The heavens proclaim the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1 ), and "We are to declare his glory among the nations" (Psalm 96:3 ). We are to use the gift of language God has given us to declare his glory. Even though God has not "left himself without testimony" or witness (Acts 14:17), He still calls His people to be witnesses to who He is and what He has done. 
2. Scripture as a Witness. It would have been amazing to walk with Jesus and the two disciples on the road to Emmaus when "beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself" (Luke 24:27). This 
3. The Apostles as Witnesses. The 4 Gospels are written to give testimony to, to be witnesses of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. In 1 John 1:1-4, the Apostle John shares his experience: 

> 1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our joy complete. 

**Discussion:** Who are other examples of witnesses you can identify from Scripture? In what main ways did this person act as a witness?

#### **God Calls All of His Followers to Participate in His Mission** 

1. Who is called to be a witness? All followers of Jesus are called to participate in what God is doing in the world. There is not only one way to give witness or testimony to the mighty deeds of God. All those gifted by the Spirit of God are called to use their different gifts. We are all called to be who we're created to be and play our part in the Church, the Body of Christ. These gifts are given and distributed as the Spirit of God chooses. 
2. The gifts of the Spirit are not given on the basis of any human category like location, ethnicity, language, etc. The gifts are given as the Spirit of God chooses—to all of His followers everywhere so they can participate in His mission, in what He is doing in the world. So just as being created in God's image is the basis for all human equality and dignity, God equally calls all of His followers to full participation in His mission. 

**Discussion:** Share with each other in your group what you found most significant about being called to participate in God’s mission.

#### **Bible Translation is an Integral Part of God's Mission** 

1. God has spoken and made himself known at many time and in many ways (Heb 1:1-4) and He desires that the knowledge of His glory cover the earth as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14). There are three main ways God has made himself known: a) **through** **creation**: "For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen" (Romans 1:20); b) **through Christ**: "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father!" (John 14:9); and c) **through Scripture**, which points to Christ (Luke 24:27). 
2. When Jesus told His disciples to "go and make disciples of all the nations" (Matthew 28:19) and later told them to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8), he said this in the context of many languages being spoken in their world at that time. All the visitors in Jerusalem at Pentecost were from many of the places in the ancient world where the gospel would be taken by followers of Jesus. In order for this to happen, the message would have to be translated or interpreted into the languages spoken there. 
3. Likewise, when Paul told Timothy "the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others," this would have required translation in many contexts. There is no command to "go translate," but entrusting the message or passing it on to others is the essence of communicating the gospel through translation. 
4. As the Gospel spread and the early Church grew, followers of Jesus crossed more and more language and culture boundaries as they went to the ends of the earth. Since Scripture is one of the main ways God makes himself known, it makes sense that translation of the Scriptures was an integral part of how the Church moved across these boundaries. The translation of Scripture, was then and is one of the main ways the "knowledge of the glory of the Lord" is extended more and more in our world. 
5. Bible translation is therefore an important part of God's mission of making himself known in the world. As we participate with Him in the ministry of Bible translation, we are His witnesses and proclaim His glory among the nations. 

**Discussion**: Discuss with each other how you have grown to know God better through Bible translation in your language(s).

### **Session 3: Bible Translation in the Mission of God** 

*(105 min. Divide the group up into small groups of 5 people. Provide each participant with the discussion guide for Identity. Introduce the topic to the entire group using the information provided below. Give the small groups 20 minutes to discuss the concept and then conduct a 10 minute large group discussion during which participants can share the key ideas their small group discussed. Repeat the process for each of the topics.)*

The third topic in this Introduction to Bible Translation and The Mission of God focuses on the role of Bible translation in God’s mission. Why translate the Bible in languages in Papua New Guinea and in my particular language? These questions are addressed by exploring three ideas: Identity, Local Language and Culture, and “Ecosystems of Languages and Cultures.” 

#### **Identity** 

When we read or hear the Bible, we often encounter unfamiliar words or ideas. One of the reasons for this is that the Bible comes from a world that is very different from ours. One example is how the Bible frequently speaks of Jews and Gentiles. The Jews are the people who trace their origin to Abraham and the nation of Israel. The history books we find in the Bible were written about the Jews and the nation of Israel. The word Gentile refers to anyone who is not Jewish. Many cultures in the world have a way they refer to themselves and another word or expression for others. 

Jesus was born a Jew and lived in the culture and society of first century Palestine. In his ministry, he went first to the Jews and then later to the Gentiles. Someone's identity as a Jew or as a Gentile was very important. Part of Jewish identity was tracing their heritage back to Abraham, having their Law and Sacred Writings, following strict dietary and ceremonial laws, observing the Sabbath, and worship in the Temple. Their identity also would have been connected to the languages they spoke: Hebrew and also Aramaic. 

Who we are or the identity we have has many different dimensions. For many people, their identity is very closely connected to the place or land where they were born or live their lives. In many communities, someone's identity may be closely connected to a certain clan, family, or trade. Speaking a certain language may also be part of this identity? 

**Discussion****:** In your communities, what are some of the common dimensions of your identity or who you are as a community or as a people? What are some of the way you know that someone is from your community or that someone is from another place? Is speaking a certain language or languages part of your identity? 

#### **Local Language and Culture** 

There's an episode in the gospel of Mark where a religious leader named Jairus asked Jesus to come heal his daughter. Before Jesus arrives at Jairus's house, his daughter dies. When Jesus arrives, he went with the girl's father and mother and three of his disciples into the room where the girl was lying. Jesus takes the girl by the hand and says to her “*Talitha koum*,” which means “Little girl, get up!” Mark 5:42 says "And the girl, who was twelve years old, immediately stood up and walked around! They were overwhelmed and totally amazed." 

This is an amazing story of Jesus raising this young girl from the dead! It's interesting also because in the middle of the story told in the Greek language, Mark includes the Aramaic words that Jesus spoke to the young girl. Why did he do this? One possible answer is that Mark wanted to show that Jesus knew that the Aramaic language was an important aspect of their identity. It wasn't merely a language the girl and her parents would understand, it was an important part of their identity. Jesus wanted to identify with them by speaking their language. 

**Discussion:** What language or languages do you most closely identify with? Does Jesus speak your language(s)? How would a translation of the Bible in your language(s) be part of making it possible for God to speak your language(s)? How would this impact you and others who speak your language?

 

#### **"Ecosystems" of Languages and Cultures** 

The word "ecosystem," usually refers to different types of climate, vegetation, and animals. For example, the coast of Papua New Guinea is very different from the highlands, with different plants, trees, animals, and birds living in each place. Ecosystem is a way of referring to how every living thing within that system is connected in some way. Any change in the ecosystem can have multiple effects on other parts of the system because of the way everything is interconnected. 

Using the word ecosystem to refer to languages and cultures is a way of pointing out the way our language and culture practices are connected in some way to other people. Any change in the ecosystem of languages and cultures can have multiple effects on the languages and cultures practiced by people in that system. 

Sometimes a new plant, animal or fish is introduced into an ecosystem and the whole system is affected in some way. This is also a way of thinking about how people who speak languages that in the past were outside of our ecosystem are now in the system--and this brings about changes. For example, there was a time when English and Tok Pisin were not part of the language ecosystem of Papua New Guinea, but now they are. They are now part of the world of Papua New Guinea in which all the other languages are used. Just as new plants or animals cause changes in an ecosystem, new languages impact the language and culture ecosystem into which they're introduced. 

In a way, this helps us understand Tok Pisin as a language. Tok Pisin developed because English was introduced into Papua New Guinea with features from both English and local languages. It's important to also recognize that English, as spoken in PNG, is impacted by the ecosystem of local languages. The English spoken in PNG has features similar to English as spoken in Australia, but the variety of English spoken in PNG is different because the surrounding language and culture ecosystem is unique to PNG. 

This idea helps us understand how we use languages in our communities and in interaction with other people in other communities and cultures. It's very common and natural for us to mix languages as we speak and interact with others. This, of course, doesn't happen unless there is regular contact or interaction with people who practice other languages and cultures. As these mixtures of languages become part of how we communicate in our communities, they also become part of our identity. Sometimes the mixture of languages is just a few words borrowed from another language; other times it involves using and speaking other languages in order to communicate and interact with other people in our communities. 

In the story about Jesus and Jairus's daughter, we see this mixture of languages. The story in Mark's gospel was written in the Greek language, but Jesus' words are there in the Aramaic language. Hebrew and Latin are two other languages used in the ecosystem in which Jesus lived (see John 19:20). 

**Discussion:** What are the languages spoken in the ecosystem of your communities? To what extent is Tok Pisin or English spoken and understood? In what ways are Tok Pisin and English impacting other languages in your communities? What languages are practiced in your churches? What implications do you see for the translation of the Bible in your communities?
