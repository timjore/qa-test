# 1- The God Who Communicates

## Introduction

We believe that the ministry of Bible translation is central to the mission of God. Since the Word of God is translatable into any language, Bible translation is one of the key ways God reveals Himself in the worlds cultures and languages.

God calls the Church to participate with Him in accomplishing His mission, so Bible translation is primarily a ministry the Church. We are committed to the vision of the Church providing leadership in the planning and implementation of Bible translation programs. This Church and Community Based Bible Translation process is being developed to support the vision of Bible translation as a ministry of the Church. 

### **Session 1: The God who Communicates:** God is on a mission of self-revelation   

*(60 min. Read the passages aloud and discuss as a group.)*

1. Read the entire chapter of Genesis 1 aloud together as a group. Creation began when God said, "Let there be light and there was light." This point is repeated many times in Genesis 1 as God speaks and other aspects of creation come into existence. God said ... and there was. God could have brought creation into existence in any way, but he does it by speaking. He creates by his Word. 
2. Read Psalm 33:6-9 together. This is a beautiful, poetic way of expressing what happened at creation. Discuss this as a group if anyone has comments to share. 
3. Read John 1:1-4. John opens his Gospel with these important statements of how In the beginning, the Word already existed. The Word was with God and the Word was God. Nothing was created except through him. Jesus, the Living Word created everything that exists. 
4. Read Colossians 1:11-20. Emphasize the point that everything was created through Christ and he holds all creation together (1:16-17) 
5. Read Hebrews 1:1-4. Everything was created by the Living Word. God spoke everything into existence. In Hebrews 1:1-4, we are reminded that God spoke many times and in many ways in the past, but now in these days he has spoken through his Son who holds all things together by his powerful word. Our God speaks. Our God communicates.
